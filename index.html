                <p>The best app for your business really depends on your current challenges. If you’re looking to grow your customer base, then a lead generation app might be a solid investment. While these sometimes don’t differ much from the big name PR apps, the difference comes in the execution. With a lead generation app, the focus is purely on leading new customers to your products instead of just raising brand awareness or creating a positive image of your brand. For small and mid-sized businesses, this is generally a much better approach than pure branding. Nonetheless, it’s still somewhat speculative. At best you can determine the lifetime value of a new customer and approach this kind of app project as you would a website re-design. Solid analytics with relevant KPIs coupled with regular improvements to the app are key to success in this approach.</p>
