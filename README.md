Slides for "Should We Have an App For That? The Value of Apps For Businesses" presented at FITC Screens 2013 in Toronto, Oct 4-5.

Overview
========
For businesses whose core business isn’t mobile apps, what value can apps provide? From Branding to Lead Generation to Process Automation, there’s a broad range of ways that mobile apps can simplify internal processes or deepen offerings to customers.
Automating tasks like filling out forms that would sit in a stack of papers or showing sales people who to visit next at a glance can significantly impact the bottom line.

Speaker Bio
===========

Christina Moulton develops custom iPhone & iPad apps as Teak Mobile Inc, based on Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. She does every part of the process: starting with initial concepts then designing the interface, writing code, and submitting apps to the App Store. When she's not sailing Georgian Bay, she's wondering why more companies don't see the potential for mobile apps to make a real difference in their day-to-day business.
